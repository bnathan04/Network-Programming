Experimetnal Findings:

In order to find the Tprop and R for each simulator, we sent two messages to each. Using the equation To = 2*(Bits Sent)/R + 2*Tprop, our program solves
a system of equations to determine Tprop and R for each simulator.

The results are:

Sim1:

Bit rate R = ~1000bps
Tprop = ~0.5s

Sim2:

Bit rate R = ~1000bps
Tprop = ~2s

Sim3:

Bit rate R = ~100bps
Tprop = ~0.1s

In real life, we see different prop delays and bit rate in client-server communication due to distance, infrastructure differences, etc.
